## 1. Just program

You should be used to this, it's a typical coding question.

## 2. Refactor

The program tells the story of a user visiting a library. They search for a book, rent it, return it and then donate a book.

Nothing thrilling. But the code is badly written, refactor it so it looks like something you'd like to read.

This code is badly written, but it tells a story.
Do whatever you see fit to make it good.

## 3. Vue.js

Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqAUmgE3WyM

Build a virtual useless box using Vue.js!

It must not take you more than 45min.
It doesn't have to be deployed anywhere, running it on localhost would be enough.
Unlike real-life projects, this will not evolve into something greater, use the simplest tools for the job.
Feel free to add dependencies if it makes your life easier.
